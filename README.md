# Heart Disease Classifier

Final project for [Stats 202](http://stanford.edu/class/archive/stats/stats202/stats202.1192/) by Alex Kim, Carina Zhang, and Suraj Bulchand.

This project aims to predict heart disease status on a [modified version](https://www.kaggle.com/c/stats202stanford2018) of the [Western Cape heart disease dataset](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/datasets/SAheart.info.txt) from *Elements of Statistical Learning*. We primarily draw on classification techniques covered in *An Introduction to Statistical Learning*.

# Setup

The dataset is not included in this repository. To use the dataset with these scripts, download the individual CSV files and save them in a subdirectory of this repository titled "data".
